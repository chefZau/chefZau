### :wave: Hello there! i'm Luca

Welcome to my little corner of the internet! I'm a passionate software developer interested in machine learning, algorithmic trading, and full-stack web development &mdash; anything that can make tech work better for everyone. Currently, I'm based in London, ON, and studying Computer Science @uwo.

You can find me hitting the gym in my spare time, taking pictures with my Sony A6300, or practicing Chinese cuisine! I recently started a Study With Me zoom live streaming on which I plan to encourage people to keep on learning new tech during the pandemic.

### what I'm working on

I'm currently doing a data analyst internship [@LBM Partner Services](https://lbmpartnerservices.com/), working on a mix of data wrangling, building dashboard, and automation! In my spare time, I'm polishing up [ecommerce_web](https://github.com/chefZau/ecommerce_web) and a host of other side-projects that may or may not see the light of day :)
